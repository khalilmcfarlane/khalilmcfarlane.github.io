    <h1>About Me...</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my webpage. My name is Khalil McFarlane. I'm a Senior at the University of Pittsburgh. This 
       Spring, I will graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science and a double minor in History and Japanese Culture.
       I've taken courses in commonly taught languages like Java and C, but most of my knowledge comes from personal 
       work or professional experience. For example, I taught myself Python, HTML, and CSS over college breaks. 
       I interned in 2021 at WebstaurantStore as a Site Reliability Engineer, where I learned how to use professional tools, such as Docker and Ansible,
       and also increased my knowledge in Python and Web Development topics, such as TPC/IP and DNS. I'm a goal-oriented
       individual and I always want to improve myself. If there is an idea that I do not understand, I seek to learn 
       about it in any way possible. The main reason why I love CS is because of that passion to understand more about the world.
